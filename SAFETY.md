Welcome to Love Affair

This is a space predicated on respectfulness of all forms.  We have zero
tolerance to intentionally malicious or hateful behaviour of all forms. 
If you are experiencing duress or acute anxiety please talk to us immediately. 
If you notice somebody is making the space unharmonious, please talk to us.  

We need to work through issues in the community collectively in order to ensure
that problematic behaviours are understood, prevented, reversed, and transformed into
positive actions. If you are approached to discuss your behaviour please keep
an open mind.  

Tips: 
 - love yourself
 - use good consent
 - please don't be a creep. 
 - don't use language which insinuates prejudice of any forms, however minor. 
 - smile because you're happy
 - don't be abusive
 - don't give unwanted attention

 - respect your own body
 - respect others.
 - express your appreciation of others
 - back off when you sense somethings amiss 
 - don't leer 
 - express yourself!

This space will not oust anyone without just cause, however is certain
situations we may suggest that folks voluntarily leave to allow things to cool
down.
