## Becoming a Member

Love affair operates on a system of self appointment, and membership is open to
all. To become a member
 - first register and familiarize yourself with GitHub
 - 


To appoint yourself to a responsibility: 
 - either: 
   - identify the responsibility from [this list] 
   
we ask that you affix your name next to
the applicable responsibilities listed [here](./COOPERATIONS.md#Responsibilites) by opening a
[pull
request](https://github.com/loveaffair69/loveaffair/edit/master/COOPERATIONS.md). 

All appointments are subject to explicit agreements between the individual and
the organization, and are made legitimate only upon documentation of said
[agreements](./AGREEMENTS.md).

Membership is a three-tier system. Information on membership types can be found
[here](./COOPERATIONS.md#Membership). The role of each member is an
amalgamation of the responsibilities to which they have appointed themselves.

All members, including board members, are at all times accountable to the
organization as a whole. All appointments are subject to review at any time by
the organization and its membership.
