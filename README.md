# Love Affair
## Mission
The goal of the Love Affair event series is to create a safe and positive party environment to foster a collaborative and creative community of likeminded individuals with an interest in music, art, dance, and fashion. Love Affair incorporates live performances, DJs, video projections, dance, costumes and installations, while working collaboratively with organizations within the community to raise interest, awareness, and support to affect direct change within our community.
