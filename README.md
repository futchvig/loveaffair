## Organizational Structure Overview

Love Affair is a decentralized non-profit organization made up of peers. It is organized as a series of autonomous sub-groups which directly interact with each other and share information or provide service to other sub-groups for
the benefit of the organization as a whole. There is no single centralized authority that makes decisions on behalf of all the parties. Each sub-group makes decisions towards its individual goals.

Love Affair relies
on the independent decision making power of its (agents)[TODO] and
sub-group.  

In keeping with our commitment to absolute transparency, all information pertinent to Love Affair and its operations can be found in this GitHub
repository.

Detailed financial records can be found [here](./FINANCIAL.md).
