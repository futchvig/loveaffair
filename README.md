## Contributing

 Love affair operates on a system of self appointment, and membership is open to all.  

To become a member, first register for a GitHub account here.(ADD LINK)

To appoint yourself to any position, we ask that you affix your name next to the applicable responsibilities listed [here](./COOPERATIONS.md).

All appointments are subject to explicit agreements between the individual and the organization, and are made legitimate only upon documentation of said [agreements](./AGREEMENTS.md).

Membership is a three-tier system. Information on membership types can be found [here](./COOPERATIONS.md#Membership). The role of each member is an amalgamation of the responsibilities to which they have appointed themselves.

All members, including board members, are at all times accountable to the organization as a whole. All appointments are subject to review at any time by the organization and its membership.

## Meetings

Love Affair meets every Tuesday at 2:30 PM (unless otherwise specified) to discuss general purposes and any existing issues in the repository. Public notice of each meeting and its location will be posted each week. All meetings are open to the public.

## Organizational Structure

Love Affair is a decentralized non-profit organization made up of peers (read: members.) It is organized as a series of autonomous departments which directly interact with each other and share information or provide service to other departments for the benefit of the organization as a whole. There is no single centralized authority that makes decisions on behalf of all the parties.

Each department makes decisions towards its individual goals. Love Affair relies on the independent decision making power of its individual agents (read: members) and departments. Decisions regarding or affecting Love Affair in its entirety must be made with the full knowledge and consent of its whole membership. It is the direct responsibility of each member to uphold the values and principles of the organization, and to act in its best interest.

In the event of conflict, if an agent, member, or peer of the organization speaks, acts, or behaves in a manner deemed unacceptable by the membership, internally or externally, or if an individual's ability to fulfill their commitments to the organization is brought into question, subsequent action up to and including removal from all activities related to the organization will be decided by consensus among the members.

In keeping with our commitment to absolute transparency, all information pertinent to Love Affair and its operations can be found in this GitHub repository. Detailed financial records can be found [here](./FINANCIAL.md).
